  <h1>Privacy Policy – “La et Le”</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 27 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy explains how the “La et Le”
    Android application (“the App”) handles information. The App is developed and published by
    <strong>Seweryn Polec</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
  </p>
  <p>
    By using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The App is an offline learning tool to practice the grammatical gender (“le / la”) of French nouns
    using a spaced repetition system. It also includes an optional reminder feature that can send
    daily notifications at times you choose, so you remember to practice.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App does not require an account or sign-in.</li>
    <li>The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</li>
    <li>All data used by the App stays on your device only.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1. Data stored locally on your device</h3>
  <p>To function, the App stores a small amount of data locally on your device, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your learning progress (seen words, correct/incorrect answers, review intervals).</li>
    <li>Your statistics (e.g. number of words learned or mastered).</li>
    <li>Your settings and preferences (theme, SRS thresholds, other options in settings).</li>
    <li>Your reminder configuration (whether reminders are enabled, the chosen time, and selected days).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is stored using Android’s local storage mechanisms (for example, SharedPreferences or local files)
    and is never sent to us or to any third-party server. It is only used by the App itself to provide its
    learning and reminder features.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2. No personal data collection</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The App does not collect your name, email, phone number, address, or other personal identifiers.</li>
    <li>The App does not require account creation or login.</li>
    <li>The App does not collect location data, contacts, photos, or other device data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Internet, Network, and Connectivity</h2>
  <p>
    This version of the App is designed to be fully offline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The App does not connect to the internet to download, upload, or sync data.</li>
    <li>The App does not perform in-app update checks or remote configuration.</li>
    <li>Any updates to the App are handled solely through the Google Play Store or by the user manually.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are no external API calls, no online services, and no background network communication implemented in
    the App’s source code.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Permissions, Analytics, Tracking, and Advertising</h2>

  <h3>4.1. Permissions used</h3>
  <p>The App requests the following permissions to support its reminder and internal functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS</code><br />
      Used so the App can show practice reminder notifications at the time you choose. You can enable or disable
      notifications in your device settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</code><br />
      Used to schedule precise reminder times so notifications appear at the exact time you configure.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</code><br />
      Used so that, after your device restarts, the App can re-schedule any previously configured reminders.
      This ensures that your notifications continue to work after a reboot without you needing to set them up again.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>com.languageapp.laetle.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION</code><br />
      This is an internal permission used only inside the App to control how certain broadcast receivers work.
      It is not used to access personal data from other apps or from your device.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These permissions are used exclusively to provide the reminder feature and to manage internal App behavior.
    They do not give the App access to your personal files, contacts, photos, or location.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2. Analytics, tracking, and advertising</h3>
  <p>The App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not use analytics tools (no Firebase/Google Analytics, etc.).</li>
    <li>Does not use advertising SDKs.</li>
    <li>Does not show advertisements.</li>
    <li>Does not track your behavior or usage across apps or websites.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Content and Licences</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses an offline dataset containing the following columns for each entry:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Word</strong> (French noun)</li>
    <li><strong>Gender</strong> (grammatical gender, e.g. “le” or “la”)</li>
    <li><strong>English Translation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Audio_Credits</strong> (attribution for pronunciation audio)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Only individual words and their audio samples are included. No example sentences or longer text excerpts
    are used in this version.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dataset is derived from publicly available, openly licensed resources and is redistributed under
    <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
    The data is available at:
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vzL0dRPHlKJB6pW7bTRvJgzCwBBxFz4J/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    </a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Word list source:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequency Words — French 50k list (HermitDave / FrequencyWords, CC BY-SA 4.0).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Audio recordings:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All pronunciation audio is sourced from
      <a href="https://lingualibre.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinguaLibre.org</a>,
      licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
    </li>
    <li>Audio files have been converted to mono and optimized for file size to improve app performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These third-party resources are bundled locally and are not used for tracking or analytics. Attribution to
    audio contributors is provided in the in-app Licences screen and project documentation.
  </p>


  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy and Content</h2>
  <p>
    This version of the App contains only single-word entries and their English translations; no example sentences or
    phrases are included. It is designed to avoid inappropriate text content and to comply with a 13+ rating
    on Google Play.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since the App does not collect personal
    data or connect to servers, we have no way to identify individual users, including children.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child (for example, if you
    contacted us by email and provided such information), please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:sewerynpolec@gmail.com">sewerynpolec@gmail.com</a>, and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because the App does not transmit data to any server, your learning data is stored only on your device.
    The security of this data depends on your device and its settings (screen lock, encryption, backups, etc.).
    We recommend using a secure lock screen, keeping your operating system up to date, and managing backups
    according to your preferences.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Uninstalling the App:</strong> You can uninstall the App at any time. This will delete the App and its
      locally stored data from your device (subject to your device’s backup settings).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because we do not store any data on our servers, we cannot restore your progress if it is deleted or lost.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if the App’s features change. The latest
    version of the policy will always be available at this URL.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we make significant changes affecting how data is handled, we may also update the “Last updated” date
    and mention the change in the app’s release notes.
  </p>
